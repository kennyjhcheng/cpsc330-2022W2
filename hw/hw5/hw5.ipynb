    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "1. `area code` makes sense to be encoded using OHE, as it provides location information that is different than the `state` feature and isn't unique to each example like the `phone number` feature. There are discrete, finite categories of the `area code` feature such that each example is classified into one of them, therefore it can be considered a categorical feature.\n",
    "2. There are 3 possible values of `area code = {415, 510, 408}`\n",
    "3. Because there are 3 possible values of `area code`, the OHE of the feature will create 3 columns to replace it: `area code_415`, `area code_510`, `area code_408`"
